# Instructions
In this game, it is assumed that 2 players are sitting in front of a console and are playing TicTacToe. The first player will make a move and present an 'x' on the board on places 1 to 9. The board is divided as follows: 

1|2|3
-+-+-
4|5|6
-+-+-
7|8|9

Then, the next player picks a number from 1-9 that is not yet occupied and places an 'o' on the board. The game keeps running until there is a winner or all spaces are occupied. A player wins when there are 3 of the same symbols are placed on the board in a row. It's a tie if the players run out of turns.

After the game, the program asks for a rematch. When 'n' or any other string that is not 'y' is typed in the command line, the game ends.
